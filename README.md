# Wrapper: Offline
Wrapper: Offline is a GoAnimate Server Emulator carrying on the torch of [VisualPlugin's GoAnimate Wrapper project](https://github.com/GoAnimate-Wrapper) after its shutdown in 2020. Unlike the original project, Offline can not be shut down by Vyond. Why? It's because everything is hosted and programmed to function locally, no internet access required, barring the initial download (and TTS at this time). This project is important for archival purposes, as the ability to use this legacy editor and themes would be far trickier without it. Besides the main feature of Offline, we have also added other additional features and improvements compared to the original GoAnimate Wrapper project, and there will be more to come, as Offline will continue to get additional updates in the future.

## Running / Installation
To start Wrapper: Offline on Windows, open wrapper-offline.exe. It'll automate just about everything for you and, well, start Wrapper: Offline.

If you want to import videos and characters from other instances of Wrapper: Offline, open its folder and drag the "_SAVED" and "_ASSETS" folder into the Wrapper: Offline folder. If you have already made any videos or characters, this will not work. Please only import on a new install with no saved characters or videos, or take the folders in Wrapper: Offline out before dragging the old one in. If you want to import character IDs from the original LVM, you can click on CREATE A CHARACTER in the video list, scroll down to "Copy a character", and type in a character ID.

## Updates & Support
For support, the first thing you should do is read through the FAQ, it most likely has what you want to know. Alternatively, If you can't find what you need, you can join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/Kf7BzSw). Joining the server is recommended, as there is a whole community to help you out.

## Dependencies
This program relies on Flash and Node.js to work properly. Luckily, they require no download, as they have already been included in Wrapper: Offline.

## License
Most of this project is free/libre software[1] under the MIT license. You have the freedom to run, change, and share this as much as you want.
This includes:
  - Files in the "wrapper" folder
  - Batch files made for Wrapper: Offline
  - Node.js

FFmpeg is under the GNU GPLv2 license, which grants similar rights, but has some differences from MIT. Flash Player (extensions folder) and GoAnimate's original assets (server folder) are proprietary and do not grant you these rights, but if they did, this project wouldn't need to exist.

These are unaffiliated people that they haven't directly done anything for the project (and probably don't even know it exists) but still deserve credit for their things. Kinda like a shoutout but in a project's readme. ***Please do not contact them about Wrapper: Offline.***
